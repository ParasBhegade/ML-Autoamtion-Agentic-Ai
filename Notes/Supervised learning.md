SUPERVISED LEARNING
<summary>
-Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

-The training process involves feeding the model labeled examples, allowing it to learn the relationship between features and labels.

-Models are evaluated by comparing their predictions on unseen data to the actual values, helping to refine their accuracy.

-Once trained and evaluated, models can be used for inference, making predictions on new, unlabeled data in real-world applications.

-The quality of the dataset, including its size and diversity, significantly impacts the model's performance and ability to generalize.
