What is Machine Learning?
</h>
>Machine learning (ML) is a way to train software, called a model, to make predictions or generate content using data.

>ML systems can be categorized as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, or generative AI, each learning differently.

>Supervised learning uses labeled data to make predictions, often for regression (predicting numerical values) or classification (categorizing data).

>Unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data, commonly using clustering to group similar data points.

>Generative AI creates new content, such as text, images, or music, by learning patterns from existing data and mimicking them.

In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content (like text, images, audio, or video) from data. 

<h>Types of ML Systems</h>

ML systems fall into one or more of the following categories based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:

1.Supervised learning
2.Unsupervised learning
3.Reinforcement learning
4.Generative AI

<h>Supervised learning</h>

-Supervised Learning models can make predictions after seeing a lot of data with correct answers and then discovering the connections between the elements in the data that produces the correct answers. 
ex: learing new stuff by studying old stuff i.e predicting the next questions by reading pyqs


<h>Regression</h>

-A regression model that predict a numerical value. contious numeric value

<h> Classification</h>

-It predict the likelihood of something belonging to a category i.e it predicts the category of the given input 

Ex- It predict if a mail is spamor not. 

classification models are divided into two groups.
1.Binary - models output a value from a class that contains only two values.
ex - rain or no rain.
2.Multivariable - models output more than two values.
ex - rain,hail,snow ,etc.

<h>Unsupervised Learning</h>

Here model predicts data that does not contain full correct answers , aim is to identify meaningful patterns among the data.
-technique used here is called clustering. grouping and forming clusters.

-catergorizing is not done by us.
ex-  like the dataset will be clustered but u have to name them .
like if we have temperature dataset so model will divide them based on temp types but u have to classify them.

<h>Reinforcement Learning</h>

the model gets rewareded for correct actions and penalties for wrong hence learning model to perform better and take more correct actions.
ex- Teaching dog to perform specific actions and rewarding them whenever they perform correctly. hence dog will eventaully learn..

<h>Generative AI</h>

it is a class of model rthat generates i.e creates content from user .
ex-img , vid , audio ,etc.

it can summarize inputs and explain or edit it too.

ex- text-to-text , text-to-img , text-to-vid ,text-to-code , etc.

working - it obeserver the related data analyze it and generate new but similar output
for this model is trained using unsupervised approach.
